# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We want to create a discord bot that: (either one of these)
1) Display the live price of any cryptocurrency of our choice in the discord. 
2) Takes a live tweet from twitter and messages that to our discord group.
3) ...?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Alex Li, Python Section 003; ...?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do you have any resources for me to start out with?

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Crypto-Pricebot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

View the live price of any cyrupto currency of our choice within our private group on discord.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

To save me the problem of opening and closing google chrome to check the price of a crypto asset, the live price of any crypto asset we choose will be displayed on discord side bar. We can also add on more features to be displayed like the market cap of any coin. We would have to research how to create discord bots, and manipulate them to be able to get data from online to frequently change what is displayed (price) on discord. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At minimum we want a bot that can show atleast the price of the crypto of that day.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A bot that frequently changes the data shown on discord (frequently updates the price if not live)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To have a bot that updates the price in live time. Can also have more features to add on like the current market cap.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Definitly have to research how to create discord bots and how to get the data from a website and be able to display that on discord. We could split up the work and have one researching discord bots and how to have them update their data while the other researches how to get data from a website and be able to use it.
